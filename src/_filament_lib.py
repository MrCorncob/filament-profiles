# "enclosed" gates tier-proof only (see classify_gap): A1/A1 mini/A2L are
# Bambu's open-frame budget line with no panels, so even if the old repo
# has DIRECT evidence one engineering material works there (e.g. Bambu
# ships a "Generic PC @BBL A1" system profile), that doesn't imply an
# unrelated material like ABS is safe there too -- ABS/ASA's fumes and
# warping specifically call for an enclosure, which these printers don't
# have. Direct evidence is still trusted regardless of "enclosed", since
# it's a real vendor-declared compatibility fact, not our own inference.
# P1P/X1C/X1E system profiles exist in the old repo but have no folder in
# this repo, so they're not registered as targets -- only used as fallback
# source data for base-tier materials.

# Most codes here are the "@BBL <code>" tag old-repo deltas embed in their

# (see External references) tags its files by printer in the FILENAME
# instead -- many of its filament JSONs are complete per-printer exports
# with an empty "inherits", not small deltas -- so bambuprinters_entries()
# maps that filename token onto this same code namespace via
# BAMBUPRINTERS_TOKEN_TO_BBL_CODE below. "a2l" has no old-repo equivalent
# (the old repo predates A2L) but reference-bambuprinters/ has a real
# per-printer export tagged for it, hence it's registered here even though
# A2L has no "@BBL" code of its own in reference-old-repo/.
